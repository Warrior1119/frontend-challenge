# FE Challenge Instruction

Build a single page application that displays various Properties and Leases. Please avoid UI libraries like Material and Bootstrap. Be creative. Show off your styling abilities.

Use the wireframe image as a starting point to build a page with Property cards at the top. Clicking on a Property card should show all relevant Leases in a table.
